# there is no main function in ruby. the interpreter
# will begin executing statements in this file, so just
# place your solution below.

# remember the rules:
# - if the number is divisible by 3, print 'fizz'
# - if the number is divisible by 5, print 'buzz'
# - if the number is divisible by both 3 AND 5, print 'fizzbuzz'
# - otherwise, just print the number
